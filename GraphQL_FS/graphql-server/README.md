Set up DB: `docker-compose up -d`
Seeding initial example data: `npx prisma db seed`
View DB in Prisma Studio: `npx prisma studio`

## Work Flow be Like

Client => GraphQL Server => Pothos => Pothos/plugin-prisma => Prisma => DB

1. The client sends GraphQL queries.
2. The GraphQL server interprets these queries, calls the appropriate resolvers, and forms responses.
3. The resolvers use the Prisma client to query or manipulate the database according to the operations requested.
4. The database responds to these queries, and the data flows back through this chain to the client.

### Components needs for the architecture

1. Prisma Schema: This file defines your database models and relationships in a way that Prisma can understand. It’s essential for setting up Prisma to interact with your database correctly.
2. Prisma Client: Automatically generated by Prisma, this client allows you to perform database operations in your code using straightforward methods. It’s crucial for interacting with the database through your server.
3. GraphQL Schema: This schema defines all the types, queries, mutations, and the structure of your GraphQL API. It specifies what operations are available to the client.
4. GraphQL Resolvers: These are functions that connect the operations defined in your GraphQL schema (like queries and mutations) to the logic that fetches or modifies data, typically using the Prisma client.
5. GraphQL Server: This is the environment where your GraphQL schema and resolvers are hosted. It processes requests from the client, executes the relevant resolvers, and returns the data in the format required by GraphQL.
